# Robust-and-Explainable-Intrusion-Detection-Under-Distribution-Shift-in-Network-Telemetry
Cybersecurity research project 

This repository contains code and a full report for a defensive cybersecurity research artifact on **intrusion detection under distribution shift (concept drift)** and **explainability** for network-telemetry classifiers.

## What this project provides
- **Shift-aware evaluation** using **time/domain-based splits** (e.g., train on earlier days/domains, test on later ones).
- **Baselines** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest; extendable to others).
- **Robustness hooks** (e.g., calibration / drift checks / uncertainty) depending on your implementation.
- **Explainability** outputs (global + per-alert explanations, depending on your implementation).
- A complete **PDF report** in `paper/`.

> Defensive research only. No exploitation content.
